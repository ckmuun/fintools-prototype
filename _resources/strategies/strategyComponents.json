    "description": "Dropshipping is an e-commerce technique. The core idea is to create an online shop which basically relays any purchases made through it to other online retailers which then send the product directly to the customer. The dropshipping store owner collects a commission. Its main advantage is that it's not necessary to have a permanent storage of the goods to be sold. The main disadvantage is that you as the store owner have to take liability for deliveries and products from the third-party shops you relay the orders to. This can, theoretically, result in massive financial drawbacks. ",

    "description": "ETFs, Exchange Traded Funds are an asset class that was invented in the 1970s. The main idea is to setup a fund that replicates a given index like the S&P 500 or the DAX and participate in the overall development of this index instead of betting on single stocks. Furthermore, due to mimicking an index, an ETF is usually passive, which means that there is no fund manager who actively manages the funds composition. This significantly reduces the cost associated with purchasing and holding the fund over time. Usually, ETF investors also utilize a passive investment strategy, e.g. they buy and hold their assets for longer periods of time (think years up to multiple decades). ",
